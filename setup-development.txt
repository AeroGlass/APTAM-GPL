Setup development environment:
-Install: Eclipse + Android SDK + Android NDK
-Please look online for setup instructions.

Tested development environment:
-NDK: android-ndk-r9d
-Eclipse-ADT-Bundle: adt-bundle-windows-x86_64-20140321
-Built for Android 4.3

Setup APTAM:
-Import the APTAM project to the Eclipse workspace.
-Add native support to project (maybe delete automatically added source files).
-Run as Android Application.

Hints:
-Building lapack takes a very long time therefore I prepared some prebuild libraries for it, if they don't work change jni/Android.mk to build lapack from source.
-If you get "Problems" in eclipse but compilation works turn off "Code Analysis" (preferences->C/C++) for syntax and sematic errors.
-Additionally to the Android log further information can be found in coutlog.txt in the app directory (Android\data\at.jku.ptam\files).
-NDK sometimes does not recognize changes in header files! So you have to rebuild the project to apply those changes!

Tested devices:
-Sony Xperia Z2
-Samsung Galaxy S3 (Neo)
-Epson BT200
